# Airbnb_analysis

## Project Objective
This project aims to collect sample data from MongoDB Atlas and preprocess it to create structured data. This structured data undergoes an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process to ensure it is free of missing values and outliers. The data is then converted to a CSV file and imported into a Streamlit application to visualize the insights derived from it. A PowerBI dashboard is also created with this CSV file.

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB Atlas
- MongoDB Compass
- Pandas
- Streamlit
- Plotly
- PowerBI

## Steps Involved in This Project

## Data Collection
- Obtain MongoDB Atlas connection string.
- Connect with MongoDB Compass to download the JSON file containing sample data.

## Data Preprocessing
- Use Pandas to preprocess the data and structure it appropriately.
- Treat missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conduct EDA to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.
- Use visualizations to gain insights into the data.

## Data Visualization
- Create a Streamlit web application using the CSV file to visualize insights derived from the data.
- Create a PowerBI dashboard for interactive data analysis and visualization.
