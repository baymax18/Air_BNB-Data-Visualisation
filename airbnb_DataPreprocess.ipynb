This sojourn allows one a presence with the environment, to embark on adventures around the island, and be at ease afterward. Your occasional companions include moonlit mist-laden trades, the subtle glow of the Milky Way, and peaceful morning light as melodic birds dart about the lanai. An alluring and thought-provoking hop to the misty mountain, from Hilo or Kona, will bring you to the edge of a lush and verdant rain forest where the cabin dwells. Follow a stairway to the lanai, then passage to the entry, kitchen and living space. A second flight leads high aloft to a king bed, half bath and musings of forest and sky. The sublime of nature and place of restorative tranquility within the native rain forest.  We value, respect, and are considerate with our community and our commons. ',\n",

I love to travel, to discover new places and to meet new people.\\xa0I will be glad to hosting you in Istanbul at my place. My apartment is newly renovated, clean, cosy, comfortable, large enough for 8 people and is situated literally at the heart of Istanbul. Apartment has one of the unique examples of turn-of-the-century Levantine architecture in Turkey: slim, four-storey bow-fronted homes that huddle along winding, narrow streets.  Located in a street as it was used to be; the ground floors often served as stores or workshops.  More likes to come to your posts in Instagram ! As a traveller my wish is to make you feel at home; drink your morning coffee while listening to the sound of Istanbul then take your map, j',\n",

Os hóspedes terão acesso a todas as comodidades do apartamento e do condomínio, isso inclui maquina de lavar, piscina, sauna, academia, além de três vagas na garagem. A minha interação com os hóspedes dependerá integralmente deles. Inicialmente eu só irei me encontrar com os hóspedes no dia da chegada e da partida, porém sempre estarei disponível para sanar qualquer dúvida e resolver qualquer problema. Além disso, será um prazer dar dicas sobre o Rio e acompanha-los em passeios turísticos. O que eu mais amo ',\n",

The apartment will be furnished with a queen-sized bed, a desk , a sofa, flat-screen television, and internet / Netflix. Located north of Little Italy, Nolita was originally considered part of Little Italy but has gradually lost most of its recognizable Italian character. As trendy restaurants, bars and boutiques popped up in Nolita’s winding streets, the area started developing a separate identity from the surrounding neighborhoods. Similar to SoHo, Nolita is known for its architecture and “hip” reputation. However, Nolita lacks the high density of tourists that flock to its neighbors, allowing for a more local feel. Known for its fashionable retail, young residents and expensive apartments, Nolita is slowly splitting from its association with SoHo and Little Italy, maturing into a full-fledged neighborhood. The B/D/F/M/6/N/R trains are within 5 mins walk.',\n",

Relax on the couch, enjoy the queen-sized bed, or do some work in the sunlight dinning room. There's no better place to rest up and recharge during your stay in NYC. This used to be a private room, but we've upgraded it to a whole apt! Beautiful decor, custom built furniture, and tons of space make the apartment an incredible place to stay. You'll have the lower level bedroom and the upstairs living room and kitchen. Having one and a half baths is great for larger groups as well.

Our place is good for couples and solo adventurers.   There is a very comfortable queen-sized bed, and a comfortable couch that can turn into a full size bed that sleeps 2 if necessary. This is a spacious, renovated studio in the basement of a brownstone. You have your own separate entrance to the basement studio.  It's completely private with a private entrance.  We would never enter without telling you first and without as much advance notice as possible. We would only enter if we need to access the utility room -- which is rare. For your (and ours) safety, there is a security camera outside of the building with a view to our entrance and the entrance to the studio. You can always text or call if you have any \",\n",

Guests will have access to the whole apartment apart from main bedroom. There's lovely outdoor seating and a wrap around courtyard and a BBQ. I'm in and out but love talking to people so if I'm home happy to interact or if guests would prefer to be left alone that's fine with me. I'm always happy to give advice on how to get around, things to do in the area and tips on places to eat and of course where the best coffee is. I love being close to the city and what it has to offer but also love having lots of nature around. The harbour foreshore  walks are magic and it's so nice being close to Balmoral beach. There are also shops, restaurants, banks, cinema etc. close by. There's a variety of buses \",\n",
